====================

Redesign of my webpage (http://waldirpimenta.com)


### Contents:

- [x] home
    - todo: merge about.xhtml here, perhaps also with some bits from about.me
- [ ] works
- [ ] timeline
    - based on http://abstrusegoose.com/51
- [ ] updates
    - Automatic feed, need to think how to do it.
      Perhaps emulate friendfeed using Zapier, IFTTT or Yahoo Pipes.
      Or maybe build an app for it with Firebase.
      Sources: check out "from me" collection in feedly, my current friendfeed, github
    - Since this will provide dynamic content, have the link be added dynamically to the navbar
- [ ] blog
    - Need to think what platform to use.
      Something simple, with RSS/Atom and Discus comments
- [x] cv
- [x] contact
